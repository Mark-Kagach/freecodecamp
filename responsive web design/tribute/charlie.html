      <p>Charlie is a great man and he changed my life. He is a grandfather of rationality, most of rationality self-help books just repackage ideas he discovered decades ago.</p>
      <h3>Charlie's Most Impactful Ideas</h3>
      <h4>1. Wisdom is about avoiding known errors.</h4>
      <p><strong>Repeat what works and avoid what doesn't.</strong> Avoiding known errors is also the definition of self-love. Ask yourself: What has worked for me and what hasn't?</p>
      <h4>2. Do only things you have deep passion and natural talent for.</h4>
      <p>Deep passion and natural talent are the true sources of competitive edge. Brand and network are the by-products. You can develop them separately but they are of little use unless you have deep interest and natural talent for the game you're playing.</p>
<p>As moats they are only useful because you'll play the long-term game, let compounding do its work and collect the returns. But you can't stay long-term in the game you aren't interested in, or don't find easier than others.</p>
<h4>3. Always look for competitive edge.</h4>
      <p>The biggest sources of competitive edge is having a deep interest in and natural talents for the game you're playing. You have to be disciplined enough to only play the games you have an edge in. Choosing any other game is the surest way to loose. The way to win Bobby Fisher is to play him anything but chess. You want to pursue games where you have an edge, that is usually developed by natural aptitude that would be sustained in the long-run.</p>
<h4>4. Stick to your circle of competence.</h4>
      <p>Your circle of competence will primarily consist of things you have deep interest and natural talents for. If some problem is outside of it and is a bottleneck delegate to others. If it is not a bottleneck avoid entirely. If bottleneck and within your circle of competence do yourself.</p>
<h4>5. Get into the right place and sit on your ass to let compounding do its magic.</h4>
      <p>It the human tendency to fuck things up when they work. You have to be not dumb enough to not fuck things up.</p>
<h4>6. Be patient for the right opportunity to come, and fierce to grab it when it's presented.</h4>
    <h4>7. Frugality is crucial for success as you won't interrupt compounding when the tough time comes.</h4>
      <p>Tough times are inevitable and come sooner or later. Frugality allows not to die and keep at it, not interrupting compounding without necessity.</p>
<p>Moreover frugality enables freedom which allows you to find the work you have passion for and wait patiently for the right opportunity to come.</p>
<h4>9. You'll be the average of people that surround you, so spend time only with high-quality people.</h4>
      <p>It's not only true that some people are a rat poison and should be avoided at all cost.</p><p>But a far bigger truth is that most people are mediocre, and only a few are exceptional. So if you want to be exceptional, and you'll always be the average of your surrounding, your surrounding must be exceptional.</p>
      
<h4>9. Pursue simplicity as it leaves no room for mistakes to hide.</h4>
      <p>Checklists are a simple way to keep your bar constantly high.</p>

<h4>10. Incentives, always incentives. </h4>
<h4>11. The best way to solve a problem is to realize that you don't need to solve it. </h4>
