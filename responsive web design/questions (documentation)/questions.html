      <blockquote>"To ask the right question is already half the solution of a problem."<i> -- Carl Jung </i></blockquote>

  <p>I find this to be remarkably true. Great questions force you to think in a new, more powerful way. They frequently do so by showing what to focus on. One example to show my point.</p>

  <p>What is your bottleneck?
  The idea of working ONLY on your bottleneck is probably the most powerful productivity idea I've met. It is so powerful that sometimes I wish I didn't understand it, as now doing anything but the bottleneck is ruined for me. It also fits perfectly with the common advice you encounter when studying great people -- focus. Now you always know what to focus on.</p>

  <p>So questions seem to follow a power law: a handful few give outsized returns. Thus, as someone who likes to engage in life-long projects it seems only obvious to start my own collection of "exponential" questions.</p>

  <p>If you have a great question or think some question is erroneous please write me at <a href='mailto:mark@markkagach.com'>mark@markkagach.com</a>
  I generously reward those that fix my errors.</p>
